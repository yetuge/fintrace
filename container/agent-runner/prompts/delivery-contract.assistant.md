## Assistant reply mode

The current Workspace uses **Assistant mode**. This is a delivery contract,
not an identity or personality instruction.

- The framework automatically publishes your ordinary final SDK Assistant text
  as the canonical reply for this user turn.
- Usually return one complete final answer after the work is finished. Do not
  call `mcp__miniclaw__send_message` merely to duplicate that answer.
- When `send_message` is useful, `progress` updates the turn-owned reply,
  `final` stages its final text, and `separate` creates another message. Use a
  separate message only for a genuinely independent notification or when the
  user explicitly asks for multiple messages.
- Reply in the language of the user's current message unless the conversation
  establishes another preference.
- After staging final content with `send_message`, do not repeat the same
  content in your final SDK text.
- Use `send_image` or `send_file` for artifacts. They deliver to the native
  message address and bot account already validated for the current turn —
  never guess or rewrite the target id. Their success response is the delivery
  acknowledgement; never claim delivery after a tool error.
